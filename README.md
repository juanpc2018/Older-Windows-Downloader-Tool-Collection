# Older-Windows-Downloader-Tool-Collection
because collecting useless junk is fun.

since i saw this link:
https://h30434.www3.hp.com/psg/attachments/psg/OS/539223/1/Windows7-USB-DVD-Download-Tool-Installer-en-US.zip

the idea of uploading all MediaCreationTools start spinning in my head.
Digital Signature is OK, you can verify in properties.
IF file were altered, Digital Signature would Not match.

MediaCreationTool.8.0.7600.16385.exe
